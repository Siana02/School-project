1.2 Problem Statement

The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into financial services has proven to be a transformative force within the global fintech industry, offering potential benefits such as improved customer experiences, enhanced risk management, and operational efficiency. However, despite the remarkable advancements AI can bring, Kenyan fintech companies face substantial challenges in its adoption. These challenges include high initial investment costs, a shortage of skilled AI professionals, concerns about data privacy and security, and regulatory complexities, which hinder the widespread implementation of AI technologies.

While AI adoption in the global fintech landscape has been rising steadily, the local context in Kenya presents unique obstacles, including limited access to capital, insufficient technological infrastructure, and resistance to change within organizational cultures. Additionally, despite the promising potential for AI-driven financial services to enhance Kenya's fintech sector, many smaller fintech firms struggle to implement and leverage these technologies due to these constraints. Therefore, there is a need to assess the current state of AI adoption among Kenyan fintech companies, evaluate the benefits and challenges they face, and identify strategies to overcome these barriers.

This research seeks to fill this gap by exploring how Kenyan fintech firms are adopting AI technologies, examining the benefits of AI in the sector, and addressing the challenges these companies encounter. The study aims to provide actionable insights that will help fintech companies in Kenya navigate the AI adoption process and unlock the full potential of these technologies to foster financial inclusion, enhance competitiveness, and drive growth in the sector.

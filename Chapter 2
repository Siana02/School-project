Summary of Chapter 2: Literature Review

Introduction: Chapter 2 of this project provides a comprehensive review of the existing literature on artificial intelligence (AI) in the fintech sector. It begins by outlining the significant role that AI plays in reshaping financial services, with a particular focus on its application, challenges, economic impact, and regulatory considerations.

Key Themes and Findings:

1. AI in Financial Services: The chapter begins by explaining how AI has become a cornerstone of innovation within financial institutions. AI technologies, such as machine learning (ML), robotic process automation (RPA), and natural language processing (NLP), are transforming traditional financial services by enhancing efficiency, reducing operational costs, and providing more personalized customer experiences.


2. Emerging Trends and Use Cases in Fintech: A major part of the review discusses various practical applications of AI in fintech, highlighting customer service improvements, fraud detection systems, and investment advisory services like robo-advisors. The review emphasizes that AI is no longer a distant future technology but is already integrated into many fintech solutions.


3. Challenges in AI Adoption: The literature highlights several barriers preventing AI adoption in fintech firms:

Data privacy and security concerns: There are growing worries about how AI handles and protects sensitive data.

Skills and talent shortage: Fintech companies struggle to find qualified professionals to develop and manage AI systems.

High implementation costs: While AI promises efficiency, the initial costs of deployment and maintenance are high, which may deter smaller companies from integrating AI into their processes.



4. Economic Impacts: The project explores how AI automation impacts the financial services industry economically. AI is viewed as a key tool to reduce operational costs and enhance productivity. However, the economic implications on employment due to automation and potential job displacement are noted as areas requiring further research.


5. Regulatory Compliance and Governance Issues: Regulatory challenges are considered one of the biggest hurdles for fintech companies trying to implement AI solutions. The regulatory environment for AI is still evolving, and different jurisdictions have different regulations. This lack of clarity creates risks, particularly when fintech firms operate in multiple countries. Non-compliance with these evolving regulations could result in fines and reputational damage.


6. Opportunities and Risks of AI in Fintech: The chapter identifies both opportunities and risks associated with AI in fintech. On the one hand, AI can offer enhanced customer experiences and operational efficiencies. On the other hand, it poses risks related to algorithmic biases, data privacy, and security vulnerabilities.


7. Governance Frameworks for AI in Fintech: The need for robust governance frameworks to guide AI implementation is emphasized. These frameworks should address ethical considerations, compliance with data protection laws, and the development of transparent and explainable AI systems. Regular audits and legal consultations are essential to ensure ongoing compliance.


8. Summary of the Literature Review: The chapter concludes with a table summarizing the key points from the reviewed articles. The table categorizes articles based on their focus areas, such as AI in customer service, the economic impact of AI automation, regulatory concerns, and the benefits and challenges of adopting AI in fintech.

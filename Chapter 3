Summary of Chapter 3: Research Methodology

Introduction:
This chapter outlines the research design, target population, data collection methods, and analysis techniques employed in studying AI adoption by fintech companies in Kenya. The approach ensures a detailed and reliable examination of the benefits, challenges, and adoption trends of AI technologies.

Key Components:

1. Research Design:
A descriptive research design was used to capture detailed data about AI adoption. This design allowed for an in-depth understanding of trends, patterns, and perceptions surrounding AI in fintech.


2. Target Population:
The study focused on all 32 digital lenders registered with the Central Bank of Kenya. Senior management and IT managers were the key respondents due to their roles in AI implementation.


3. Data Collection Procedure:
Structured questionnaires were distributed online, followed by follow-ups through emails and phone calls to ensure high response rates. Virtual meetings clarified any doubts about the survey.


4. Pilot Testing:
A small pilot test was conducted to refine the questionnaire. Feedback from three to five digital lenders helped improve its content and structure.


5. Validity and Reliability:
The questionnaire's validity was ensured through expert reviews, while Cronbach's alpha was used to assess reliability, targeting a value of 0.70 or higher.


6. Data Analysis:

Descriptive Statistics: Summarized demographic and response data using measures like mean, median, and variance.

Regression Analysis: A multiple regression model analyzed the relationship between AI benefits/challenges and adoption levels.

SPSS: Data visualization was done using tables, charts, and graphs.


☆CHAPTER 3 TEST QUESTIONS☆

●Research Design

1. Why was a descriptive research design chosen?

Answer: It allows for detailed exploration of AI adoption trends, patterns, and challenges in fintech.


2. What are the limitations of a descriptive research design?

Answer: It does not establish causation and may not capture dynamic changes over time.


●Target Population

3. Why were digital lenders chosen as the target population?

Answer: Digital lenders are pivotal in fintech innovation, leveraging AI for efficiency, fraud detection, and customer engagement.


4. Why was a census conducted instead of sampling?

Answer: The small population size (32 companies) allowed for comprehensive coverage and more reliable findings.


●Data Collection

5. What were the advantages of using online questionnaires?

Answer: They are efficient, cost-effective, and convenient for reaching respondents in dispersed locations.


6. How were follow-ups conducted to ensure high response rates?

Answer: Through emails, phone calls, and virtual meetings for clarifications.


●Pilot Testing

7. Why was pilot testing necessary?

Answer: To identify and address ambiguities, ensuring the questionnaire was clear and relevant.


8. How did feedback from pilot testing improve the study?

Answer: It refined the questionnaire’s structure, content, and length for better respondent comprehension.


●Validity and Reliability

9. What is content validity, and how was it ensured?

Answer: Content validity ensures the questionnaire items represent the study's key constructs, achieved through expert reviews.


10. What does a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.70 indicate?

Answer: It indicates acceptable internal consistency of the questionnaire items.


●Data Analysis

11. Why was SPSS used for data analysis?

Answer: SPSS offers robust statistical tools for analyzing data, creating visualizations, and conducting advanced tests like regression.


12. What was the purpose of using multiple regression analysis?

Answer: To determine how independent variables (AI benefits/challenges) influence the dependent variable (AI adoption level).


13. What insights were gained from correlation analysis?

Answer: It revealed the strength and direction of relationships between variables.


●Challenges and Improvements

14. What challenges might arise in data collection, and how were they mitigated?

Answer: Challenges included low response rates and unclear questionnaire items, mitigated through follow-ups and pilot testing.


15. How could the methodology be improved for future studies?

Answer: Incorporate mixed methods (qualitative interviews) to provide deeper insights into AI adoption.

☆CHAPTER 3 ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ☆

1. What ethical considerations were addressed in this study?

Answer: Ensuring respondent confidentiality and obtaining informed consent for data collection.


2. How were biases minimized during the research process?

Answer: By using structured questionnaires and conducting a census to avoid sampling biases.


3. What alternative statistical tools could be used if SPSS were unavailable?

Answer: Alternatives include R, Python (with libraries like pandas and NumPy), or Microsoft Excel.


4. What role does factor analysis play in this study?

Answer: It validates construct measures by identifying underlying variables or factors within the data.


5. How can fintech firms use the findings from this study?

Answer: To enhance AI adoption strategies, address challenges, and leverage AI’s benefits for competitive advantage.
